## Description

This project provides a solution to manage and generate scripts dynamically based on user input for various web projects. The system consists of two main components: a backend (built with Express.js) and a frontend (built with Nextjs).

### Solution Overview:
1. **Backend**: The backend uses an Express.js server that offers an API for managing projects. It allows creating new projects, retrieving project details, and generating scripts asynchronously using a task queue (Bull). The scripts are then stored on the server and can be fetched as required.
   
2. **Frontend**: The frontend uses Nextjs to interact with the backend, allowing users to input project details and view generated scripts. The application communicates with the backend using React Query to fetch data and display it dynamically.

## Backend

The backend of the application is built with **Express.js**, which handles all the API requests related to project management and script generation. We use **Bull** as a task queue to manage script generation asynchronously, and **Redis** as the backend storage for Bull.

### Backend Setup

1. **Dependencies**:
   - `express` - Web framework for Node.js.
   - `bull` - A task and job queue library.
   - `redis` - Redis client to interact with Redis.
   - `cors` - To enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for frontend-backend communication.
   - `body-parser` - Middleware to parse JSON request bodies.

### API Endpoints

- **POST `/projects`**:
   - Create a new project. 
   - Request Body: `{ name: string, url: string }`
   - Returns: Created project with ID and script (once script is generated).

- **GET `/projects`**:
   - Retrieve the list of all projects with their IDs and names.

- **GET `/project/:id`**:
   - Retrieve project details by ID, including the generated script.

## Frontend

The frontend is a simple React application that interacts with the backend APIs to create, retrieve, and display projects and their generated scripts. We use **React Query** for fetching and caching data, making the UI responsive to backend updates.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Dependencies**:
   - `react-query` - Library for managing and caching server data.

3. **Run the Frontend**:
   - Make sure the backend server is running.
   - Run the frontend using a React development server:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

### Frontend Usage

1. **Create a Project**:
   - The user can create a new project by providing a name and URL.
   - The system automatically triggers the generation of a script for the project once it’s created.

2. **View Project Details**:
   - Users can view details of a project, including the generated script, once the task completes.

3. **List All Projects**:
   - Users can fetch and display a list of all projects with their IDs and names.

Feature Improvements
Dynamic Script Generation Based on User Requirements:
A key feature improvement is to give users the ability to select different variations for their scripts. This would allow them to customize their generated scripts based on specific requirements, such as tone, content type, or formatting preferences. The backend would process these variations dynamically, making the script generation more flexible and user-driven.

User Authentication & Authorization:
For production use, it’s crucial to implement a robust authentication and authorization system to secure the APIs and ensure that only authenticated users can manage their projects. This would allow users to create, update, and delete their projects securely.

Scaling with Job Queues:
As the application scales, adding more workers to the Bull task queue will be necessary to handle multiple script generation tasks concurrently. This will ensure faster processing and no delays for users even during high demand.

Script Generation Logic Optimization:
Currently, the script generation is static. A more sophisticated and flexible logic needs to be developed, allowing users to select different parameters that affect the generated script. This could include choosing a template, defining specific parameters, and applying conditional formatting, making the process more personalized and dynamic.

Frontend UI/UX Enhancements:
Enhancing the user interface to allow for an intuitive and interactive experience is essential. Adding better loading indicators, progress bars for long-running tasks, and more responsive error messages will ensure users are informed about their tasks and the application’s state.

Persistent Storage with Database:
Currently, project data is stored in memory (an array). For production use, a permanent database like PostgreSQL or MongoDB should be used for storing project data, ensuring persistence. Additionally, incorporating data backup and disaster recovery mechanisms would safeguard against data loss.

Real-Time Notifications and Progress Tracking:
Users should be able to receive real-time notifications about the status of their script generation. This could include notifications for task completion, errors, and updates on the script generation process. A WebSocket-based approach or integration with push notifications could be considered.

## Running the Project

To run this project, please ensure you have Redis installed.
### Backend
